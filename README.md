## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Variables)
- Fluid Typography (CSS clamp)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project, I focused on creating a truly fluid layout and mastering custom list styling.

- **Fluid Typography and Spacing:** I used the `clamp()` function extensively to create a seamless transition between mobile and desktop sizes without relying solely on many media queries.
- **Custom Counters:** I implemented `counter-reset` and `counter-increment` to style the ordered list of instructions, giving me full control over the numbers' appearance.
- **Advanced CSS Selectors:** I used pseudo-elements like `::marker` and `::after` for decorative elements and custom list bullets.
